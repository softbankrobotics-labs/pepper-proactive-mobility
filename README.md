# Proactive Mobility for Pepper (NAOqi 2.5)

With his application, Pepper goes towards people to talk to them, and
returns home when nobody is around, with a choice of three possible
ways to define the home point (Pepper's charging station, a dedicated
ARUCO marker, and Pepper's built in SLAM).

Using the ARUCO-based localization system requires printing out a
special marker with precise codes and dimensions; see [this template

Here is an example design:
